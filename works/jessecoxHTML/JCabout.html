      Jesse Lewis Cox is a YouTube personality, owner of a channel mostly dedicated to Let's Plays and First Looks on a range of games, both Indie and Triple A.
      As a comedian, his main tools are usually referential jokes, innuendos, multiple voices (coming from an amateur training as a voice actor) and controversial comments.
      This leads him to occasionally being regarded as a man-child, but his knowledge of the game's industry, real life issues and topics, and pop culture is well known among his peers, fans and viewers.
    </p>
    <h2 class="trebuchet">Before YouTube</h2>
    <p class="trebuchet">
      Having studied at the State University of New York (S.U.N.Y) at Buffalo in New York state, Jesse has a bachelor's degree in Theater, and a Master's degree in History, which explains his knowledge of American and universal history, along with certain geographical knowledge (Jesse has said that, if there's a country on the map that he cannot find, it's because it has changed its name since he learned of it).
      With those titles, he started a career as an educator, teaching low-income youth, a job which solidified his personality and gave him skills in discourse and entertainment.
    </p>
    <p class="trebuchet">
      He pursued a voice acting career, participating in various World of Warcraft machinima projects and providing the voice for the alternate skin "Spriticus" of the hero Nymphora in Heroes of Newerth.
      This has taken a secondary place, since he now works full time on YouTube.
    </p>
    <p class="trebuchet">
      In 2010, after being "let go" from his job, and finding himself with a lot of free time and some saved up money, Jesse upgraded his computer and equipment, and started working on his hobby as a YouTuber.
      Eventually, his early success allowed him to make a career out of this media, which continually grows to this day.
    </p>
    <h2 class="trebuchet">YouTube Career</h2>
    <p class="trebuchet">
      Jesse started his YouTube channel under the name "OMFGcata" where he covered the beta of World of Warcraft: Catacylsm.
      This made him one of the main providers of content regarding the expansion along with TotalBiscuit.
      Once he stopped delivering content from the WOW expansion, Jesse expanded his content to other games, eventually changing his channel name to simply "Jesse Cox".
    </p>
    <p class="trebuchet">
      He was part of TGS (The Game Station), an MCN (multi channel network) in which he was prominently known for being a co-host of the TGS podcast with TotalBicuit and Dodger.
      After TGS disbanded, he joined Polaris, another MCN made by the same people behind TGS, where the TGS podcast continued under the name <a href="../cooptionalpodcastHTML/COPhome.html" target="_blank">"The Co-optional Podcast"</a> with the same hosts and premise as its predecessor.
    <p class="trebuchet">
      One of his biggest collaboration with Polaris was the Polaris Civil War, where he was the officiator. After Polaris continued the event without him, he decided to leave the MCN and continue his career without one, following the footsteps of the <a href="../cooptionalpodcastHTML/COPhome.html" target="_blank">Co-optional Podcast></a>.
